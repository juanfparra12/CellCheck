# CellCheck
Cell Carrier/Tower Comparison Application 

CellCheck aims to provide users with quick access to data plans offered by AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. 
In addition to this, users will be able to compare prices and services between the four major providers.
Users benifit from quick access time thanks to our optimised use of an SQL database.
Once a user selects a plan, they will be able to view the specific coverage from the area closet to them.
